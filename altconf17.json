It's like flossing; everybody knows they ought to be doing it, but nobody does it as much as they should. And that's because it's kind of a pain -- setting up a proper A/B test requires setting up your app so that it can run these tests, making sure you're delivering the right variations to the right groups of users, accurately measuring those results, and drawing the right conclusions. It requires a fair amount of work, and maybe a background in Bayesian statistics. But with some of the new features Firebase has added to its platform, this process is now a bit easier. Come on by this presentation, and we'll show you how to set up your app so that you can easily change values on the fly, how to kick off an A/B test to experiment on some new change, and how to measure and interpret the results in ways that will make your app better. There will be live coding, some color-changing buttons, and maybe even some graphs! So swing on by; it‚Äôs sure to be a gasp-a-minute thrill ride! \n\nYou're still on your own with the flossing, though.","description":null,"url":"https://altconf.com/17/sessions/d2bb8a8ab787ea7dcbeb04db17995f5db73c2511","begin":"2017-06-06T14:00:00-07:00","end":"2017-06-06T14:45:00-07:00","duration":45.0,"day":{"id":"2017-06-06","date":"2017-06-06","label_de":"Tuesday","label_en":"Tuesday","type":"day"},"location":{"id":"room-2","label_en":"Room 2","label_de":"Room 2"},"track":{"id":"altconf","label_de":"AltConf","label_en":"AltConf","color":[0.082,0.678,0.239]},"lang":{"id":"en","label_de":"Englisch","label_en":"English"},"level":{"id":"advanced","label_de":"Advanced"},"speakers":[{"id":"d2bb8a8ab787ea7dcbeb04db17995f5db73c2511","name":"Todd Kerpelman"}]},{"id":"aa9b5ee2c43a021207480d8aeb3fcd25f7f3beb8","title":"Why the Func","subtitle":null,"abstract":null,"description":null,"url":"https://altconf.com/17/sessions/aa9b5ee2c43a021207480d8aeb3fcd25f7f3beb8","begin":"2017-06-06T15:00:00-07:00","end":"2017-06-06T15:45:00-07:00","duration":45.0,"day":{"id":"2017-06-06","date":"2017-06-06","label_de":"Tuesday","label_en":"Tuesday","type":"day"},"location":{"id":"room-2","label_en":"Room 2","label_de":"Room 2"},"track":{"id":"altconf","label_de":"AltConf","label_en":"AltConf","color":[0.082,0.678,0.239]},"lang":{"id":"en","label_de":"Englisch","label_en":"English"},"level":{"id":"advanced","label_de":"Advanced"},"speakers":[{"id":"aa9b5ee2c43a021207480d8aeb3fcd25f7f3beb8","name":"Daniel Steinberg"}]},{"id":"2bfa00ad9eadb3c394a42c46ee102659e7b22c3e","title":"Industry Report: Mac Developers Survey Results","subtitle":null,"abstract":" - Choosing the Marketplace\n - App distribution channels\n - Selling via the Mac App Store\n     - 30% revenue share\n     - App Store limitations\n\n - Selling outside the Mac App Store\n    - reasons developers leave\n    - what it takes to sell an app\n    - making your own distribution tools\n    - \n - Challenges developers face and the solutions they find\n - and much more.\n\nThe answers to these questions were collected via an annual Mac Developer Survey: 700+ developers responded to it.

Therefore, the time has come to see where else Swift can be used beyond the Apple ecosystem. While IBM has taken Swift to the data center, in this talk my colleague Laurie Hannon and I present our adventures taking Swift the other way--to the very small devices of the Internet of Things (IoT). Does Swift run on an inexpensive microcontroller running with a clock of just 48 MHz and only 20 kilobytes of RAM running on a coin-cell battery designed to power the computer for a year? Attendees of this session get to discover the answer as we hack through bare-metal details behind Swift and the LLVM compiler suite on which it‚Äôs built. And why even bother with Swift on tiny IoT computers? As we present our findings, we‚Äôll discuss some of the reasons why Swift (and Rust!) on constrained hardware might actually be a good idea.","description":null,"url":"https://altconf.com/17/sessions/dbe1765f11b96bd6f443c763a0782be085b5878b","begin":"2017-06-08T10:00:00-07:00","end":"2017-06-08T10:45:00-07:00","duration":45.0,"day":{"id":"2017-06-08","date":"2017-06-08","label_de":"Thursday","label_en":"Thursday","type":"day"},"location":{"id":"room-2","label_en":"Room 2","label_de":"Room 2"},"track":{"id":"altconf","label_de":"AltConf","label_en":"AltConf","color":[0.082,0.678,0.239]},"lang":{"id":"en","label_de":"Englisch","label_en":"English"},"level":{"id":"advanced","label_de":"Advanced"},"speakers":[{"id":"dbe1765f11b96bd6f443c763a0782be085b5878b","name":"Steven Gray"}]},{"id":"b07636c7ec0ae25bf0cb2751dd85fb3e8654b443","title":"Taking control of animations","subtitle":null,"abstract":"With Apple spending years on promoting fire-and-forget API for animations, it's important to step back and reconsider when to use these and when it's crucial to have more control over lifecycle of animation.\nThis talk explores reasons for you to want to have better control over animations and how to achieve that.

However, as app developers, we do not need to be experts to utilize the ML tools available to enhance our apps. \nUsing machine learning in our apps can help us better understand our users so that we can build a better product for them üî®üòé. This talk will cover:\n\n1. Brief overview of foundational ML concepts (neural networks, training, inference)\n2. Examples of how machine learning could help enhance your app and when it is practical\n3. Where training vs inference occur\n- training is computationally too expensive to do on device for now\n- inference can be done on device using pre-trained model\n- examples of architecture setups you can have for where training and inference are done (own machines vs cloud vs MLaaS provider vs device)\n4. What's currently available from Apple & 3rd parties + DEMO\n- Apple released 2 APIs, both using convolutional neural networks which are most suitable for describing objects in a given photo\n> Accelerate BNNS (*CPU*): Basic Neural Network Subroutines\n> MPSCNN (*GPU*): ‚ö°Ô∏è Metal ‚ö°Ô∏èü§ò Performance Shader Convolutional Neural Networks\n- DEMO with code samples of how to use them \n- What the future may hold(!!). Apple hired many ML experts over the past year, acquired Turi, and started making their own GPUs, so it seems like they are heavily investing in this direction. During the week of AltConf / WWDC, new exciting advancements may come out, and I'd like to touch on how these can be utilized.\n5.
